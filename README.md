# mymovies (OMDb API Client)

The require for this project was to create a table of images of
some films thanks the OMDb API.


We created 3 files:

*Main.js – A file wrote in Javascript language that calls
the file App.vue.
* App.vue – The extension (.vue) stands for the name of
a framework of Javascript. And it prints the table of the
films with a little description of it, thanks to
FilmDetail.vue
* FilmDetail.vue – This file works with the App.vue
because it passes some parameters like the film title,
the year of release and the genre.
